# MarkovTextParser

## Description

This project takes an input text file and transforms the contents using a Markov chain algorithm. A user can use the simple React web UI to input a text file and a prefix size.

The algorithm used to parse text works by splitting the text into prefixes and suffixes. A table is created with pairs of prefixes and suffixes from the text, and a randomized output is generated from this table. The user has the ability to change the prefix size (the number of words in the prefix) and the maximum output size (the number of words output).

For example, we can take the sentence 

> "she sells sea shells and she sells tea"

For a prefix size of 2, we can loop through the sentence to identify all prefixes and suffixes. From the beginning to the end, we get:

| Prefix        | Suffix         
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| she sells     | sea, tea      |
| sells sea     | shells        |
| sea shells    | and           |
| shells and    | she           |
| and she       |  sells        |
| sells tea     |               |

We can see that one prefix may have more than one suffix. In this case, we choose to output the first suffix. We also notice our last prefix does not have a suffix. We ignore this case.
So, at random, our output of size 10 might be 

> "sells sea shells sea shells and and she sells"

## Run the Project

There are two components to this project: a backend server and a web UI.

### Backend Requirements
- Gradle 4+
- JDK 17.0.4

#### To run the backend server:
Open a command line terminal and navigate to the backend/demo folder. Run the commands to clean & run the backend server: 

  `cd ./demo`

  `./gradlew clean`

  `./gradlew bootRun`

Your server will run on local port 9000. You will see an "Application is Running" if your server started successfully.
You will run into an error if this port is already being used.

### Web UI Requirements
- Node v14.15.4
- npm >= 5.6

#### To run the web ui:

Open a command line terminal and navigate to the frontend/markov-web-ui folder. Run the command:

  `cd ./markov-web-ui`

  `npm install`

  `npm start`

This should open up a web browser at port 3000. 

## Assumptions of File
- The file is within 0 and 2147483647 characters (the String limit in Java). With more time, an Iterable<String> or a String[] could be used to parse a longer text file through chunks.
- We are going to assume all words are separated by spaces.

## To Dos
- Add an Iterable<String> or a String[] to parse the text file into chunks, allowing for larger text files.
- Add caching to store prefixes/suffixes.
- Give the user the ability to choose suffixes. Right now, we are only using the first suffix found. An option would be to create a parameter `String[] ignoreSuffixes` or `String[] ignorePrefixes` that we use to ignore certain words when identifying suffixes or prefixes, respectively. Similarly, you could include a `String[] suffixDictionary` or `String[] prefixDictionary` such that only prefixes and/or suffixes in this dictionary can be output.
- We could train the model by identifying incorrect suffixes or prefixes. For example, we don't like having a verb as the first word in a prefix (since the prefix always comes at the beginning of the sentence). To do so, I might create a table called IgnorePrefix that stores each word that is input by the user in the `String[] ignorePrefixes` parameter. The more the model is used, the more optimized it would be. Another option for this example would be to use a third-party API such as WordNet to identify prefixes that start with verbs and exclude them from our table.
